    <h1>Landscape Urbanism.</h1>
    <p><strong>"Landscape Urbanism"</strong> was first proposed by urban designer
      <a href="second.html" target="_blank"><strong>Charles Waldheim</strong></a>,
      who advocated that buildings and infrastructure be regarded as the continuation
      of the landscape or the uplift of the ground. The landscape is not only a green
      scenery or natural space but also a continuous surface structure and the supporting
      structure of the city. The connotation of "Landscape Urbanism" mainly includes the
      restoration of industrial wasteland, natural processes as design, and landscape as
      green infrastructure. The primary systems that I would approach are resource reuse,
      future development, scale, programming, and adaptation to changes.
