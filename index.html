    <h1>Landscape Urbanism Theory</h1>
    <p><strong>"Landscape Urbanism"</strong> was first proposed by urban designer
      <a href="Week2/second.html" target="_blank"><strong>Charles Waldheim</strong></a>, <br>
      who advocated that buildings and infrastructure be regarded as the continuation<br>
      of the landscape or the uplift of the ground. The landscape is not only a green<br>
      scenery or natural space but also a continuous surface structure and the supporting<br>
      structure of the city. The connotation of "Landscape Urbanism" mainly includes the<br>
      restoration of industrial wasteland, natural processes as design, and landscape as<br>
      green infrastructure. The primary systems that I would approach are resource reuse,<br>
      future development, scale, programming, and adaptation to changes.</p>
