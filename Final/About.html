    <p id="abouttext">Hi, my name is Hairong Li, I'm currently a senior student study in University of Colorado, Boulder. <br><br>Design is omnipresent. How things are designed and built affects our daily lives in the most minuscule and broadest of forms. For this reason, I passionately believe that it is our responsibility as designers to not only uphold a certain quality of life standard but also to keep finding creative ways to keep finding creative ways to better enhance the human experience both indoors and outdoors. I aim to be a steward of the environment by integrating the knowledge and skills I have acquired in my undergraduate studies into my professional career, helping to create spaces and communities that are both resilient and socially equitable. Through thoughtful design and planning, I desire to cultivate places, experiences, and conditions that are impactful to people's wellbeing and their surroundings.</p>
