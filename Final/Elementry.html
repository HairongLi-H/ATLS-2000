  <h1>Fall 2020</h1>
  <h1>Location: Louisville Elementary School, CO</h1>
  <p>Louisville Elementary school is a moderately sized school with roughly 450 students. The current schoolyard is fairly large at 10.21 acres and is divided into four different spaces: a soccer field, a kindergarten specific play area, a 1st and 2nd grade play area, and a 3rd through 5th grade play area. Many areas of the schoolyard have recently been renovated and are in fair condition. The majority of the play equipment on the site has been updated within the past 10 years. <br><br>When visiting the schoolyard, it became very clear that the space was lacking several amenities like shade, tree coverage, and versatile play and educational opportunities. Through site analysis research we found that stormwater management could be improved on the site along with better circulation throughout the space. During our researching phase we spoke to several community members, the school principal, faculty and students. They expressed to us their primary concerns, needs, and wants for the redesigns design process, which we used to guide our design process.  In our redesign, we have chosen to leave the existing infrastructure on the schoolyard and add new amenities to provide a wider variety of play and learning opportunities.
